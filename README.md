## Description
<hr/>
Have you ever wondered how you spend your time? If you track your time using TimeTracker, you might be surprised to find that you might not be spending your time like you think you are! 

I created this web app, TimeTracker, to track my time digitally. You can create Tasks and track how you are spending your time

This project was created in React/React Bootstrap. Here's the breakdown of the components:

## How to Run
<hr/>

Run using `npm start`. 

You might have to install these additional npm packages if you don't already have them: 

`npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

`npm install react-color`

This project also contains some tests that use the Selenium framework. You can use the created tests (end with `.side` file ext) if you have the Selenium web extension installed.
